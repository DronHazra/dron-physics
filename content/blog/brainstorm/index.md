The process of brainstorming is interesting for me. There are times where I'm full of ideas, and each new idea points me in new unexplored directions.

Other times, I struggle to come up with even one.

Now, it's not as binary as I've made it out to be. When I was brainstorming for this project, while I was turning over ideas in my head over a couple days, my brain hooked on to a couple key ideas, and restricted me to them. They are:

- Some kind of physics simulation
- Quantum cryptography
- A math-driven exposition to quantum principles and intuition

I've got brief explanations for each of these.

## brief explanations

I've read and watched videos about physics simulations, especially simulating realistic bread (???) and fluid flow. I doubt I'll be able to scrape the bleeding edge, as it were, but I want to understand the physics behind physical simulations and see if I can build my own simulation engine.

As for quantum cryptography, my idea is to explore the cryptographical proofs of security and to build a demo [^I say build here, but I can see myself building a software version rather than actual lasers and stuff. I also don't have lasers, which might be an issue:)], like the one we played with at IQC.

Now for the last one, it's kind of vague, and that's on purpose. There's a wave of math exposition content out there, especially with the outstanding videos done by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw). I wonder if I can do a similar thing, probably starting in written format, where I explore some basic quantum principles and see what math led to them. To be honest, I don't actually know anything about quantum physics, other than it has something to do with probability distributions, $cos^2 x$, wave functions ($\Psi$). Let's see how far my math fundamentals can take me:)

## briefer caveats

I'm predisposed to caveat myself, so here we go:

Save for quantum cryptography, my ideas are based on fairly little knowledge. I'm not sure how challenging these topics actually are. The idea of learning about them excites me &mdash; that's why I put them there &mdash; but it's perfectly possible that these are totally above my head.

As you could probably tell, I lean pretty heavily on the theory side. This isn't a caveat _per se_, just something to notice. Theory, math and computation all the way!
